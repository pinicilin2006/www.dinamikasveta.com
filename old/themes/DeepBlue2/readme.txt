About Deeb Blue II

Deep Blue II is intended to be a simple, serene theme. It's based on a fantastic photo (link above) I found that really sets a great atmosphere for a theme. Originally created to be a blogging theme, this three column version was released due to the request of numerous people. Enjoy everyone! This one's for you! :)


Compatability

Deep Blue II is xHTML 1.1 and CSS compliant. It has been tested on Firefox 2.0.0.3, IE 6.0.2900 and IE 7. Deep Blue II was created as a theme for e107 v0.700+.
