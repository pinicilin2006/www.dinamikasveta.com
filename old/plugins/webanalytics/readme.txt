WebAnalytics adds the necessary JavaScript code to enable Google Analytics or any other javascript based web traffic logging on your e107 powered website. This eliminates the need to edit your theme.php code or hack other core files which I hope will be beneficial to beginners.

The plugin is configurable and has an admin area.
