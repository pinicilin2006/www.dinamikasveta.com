This is the modified version of my last Menu Plugin on E107.I have added original flash which can be edited in any Flash Editor.
IF you have Flash Editor you can modify the colors according to your need.
If you don't have Editor then Email me at prateekshukla2@gmail.com and I will edit the file and send it back to you.
Thank You.
Enjoy the plugin.
